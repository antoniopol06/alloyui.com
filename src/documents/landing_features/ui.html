title: The core is separated from the UI
---
<p>The main idea behind the editor is to fully separate the core from the UI. And not only to separate it, but to allow people to easily add new Buttons and Toolbars or event to create a completely new UI based on a different Framework or even vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p>AlloyEditor uses CKEditor under the hood to deal with the editable content.This means the existing CKEditor plugins can be reused.</p>
