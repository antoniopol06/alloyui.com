title: Fully separate the core from the UI
---
<p>The main idea behind the editor is to fully separate the core from the UI. And not only to separate it, but to allow people to easily add new Buttons and Toolbars or event to create a completely new UI based on a different Framework or even Vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<h2 class="feature-section">The core</h2>
<p>AlloyEditor uses CKEditor under the hood to deal with the HTML. Browsers still generate very inconsistent HTML, not to mention how buggy they are.</p>
