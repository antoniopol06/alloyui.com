	title: Properly release resources
	description: Fixed issue with detaching events registered via CKEditor's API. The issue would cause the following exception on destroying the editor: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getRanges' of null". Fixed an issue that would cause the image resize markers to be still present even when the editor was destroyed.
