<h4 class="guide-step">Passing "readOnly" configuration property to the editor</h4>

<span class="code-header">The read only mode can be set by passing the <strong>readOnly</strong> property to the editor with value `true`:</span>
<pre><code class="javascript">var editor = AlloyEditor.editable('editable', {
	readOnly: true
});
</code></pre>

<p>The value of the <code>readOnly</code> property might be `true` or `false`. If set to <code>true</code> this means changes to the content won't be possible and clicking on a link will navigate to its URL instead to open a dialog for changing it.

<p>This behavior might be changed any time using the following code: </p>
<pre><code class="javascript">var nativeEditor = editor.get('nativeEditor');
nativeEditor.setReadOnly(false);
</code></pre>
This will make the content editable again.
