<h4 class="guide-step">1 - Get ready to build AlloyEditor</h4>

<p>Follow the instructions in our <a href="guides/how_to_build_it.html">How to build it</a> Guide to know how to change and build AlloyEditor.</p>

<h4 class="guide-step">2 - Create your Skin Folders</h4>

<p>Create a new directory under <code>src/ui/react/assets/icons/</code> with the name of your skin <small>(e.g <code>zebra</code>)</small>. This will contain all the icons of your look and feel.</p>

<p>Create a new directory under <code>src/ui/react/assets/sass/skin</code> with the name of your skin <small>(e.g <code>zebra</code>)</small>. This will contain all the styling you require.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></i> You can reuse our own <a href="/guides/skins.html">Skin Architecture</a> to simplify the process of creating your own!</div>

<h4 class="guide-step">3 - Create your Skin</h4>

<p>Place all the icons you need inside an <code>svg</code> folder in your skin icon folder. These icons will be merged with the default ones, and the resulting set will be used to generate your skin icon font</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>main.scss</code> inside your skin folder. This will be the entry point of your skin and should contain all the styling of your look and feel.</p>

<h4 class="guide-step">4 - Build your Editor</h4>

<span class="code-header">Your skin will be automatically picked up when building AlloyEditor</span>
